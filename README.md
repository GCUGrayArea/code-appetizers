# Coding Appetizers

## Solution repo

This repo contains my solutions to "daily coding challenge"-type problems from a number of sources. The problem statements are pasted into the source files for the problems they solve; I'm currently mostly doing easy ones so solutions should be one file each for the time being.

Everything is written in Java as of 9/10/2020 because I'm doing these while I go through Skill Distillery and that's what I'm learning there. When I get to JavaScript I may start doing problems in that.
